Steps:
    - Sort the input array
    - Initialize a “triplets” variable
    - loop through the input array
        - if the current number is greater than 0, break out of the loop because
          the sum will not be equal to 0 anymore
        - if the current number is equal to the previous one, continue to the
          next iteration
        - call the twoSum function and pass in the input array, the current idx,
          the targetSum and the “triplets” variable

twoSum:
    - do a left and right pointer technique
    - whenever we append the result, run a while loop to increase our left
      pointer by one if the left pointer previous number is equal
