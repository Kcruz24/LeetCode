Steps:
    1. Initialize a "pairMap" to map the pairs
    2. Initialize a "prefer" map to get the preference of person i with person j
       in O(1) time
    3. Populate both maps
    4. Initialize a "ans" variable to store the answer
    5. run a double loop, the outer for the preferences and the inner for
       n - 1 range
          a. Check if x prefers u over y and u prefers x over v
          b. if true, increase “ans” by 1 and break out of the inner loop
    6. Return the “ans” variable
