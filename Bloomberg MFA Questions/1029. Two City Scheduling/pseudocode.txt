Steps:
    1. Sort in ascending order by the difference of
       each city cost. This can mean a gain or lose by the
       company depending of where we send current person.
    2. initialize an N variable indicating the persons for each
       city.
    3. initialize a city_a_cost variable to store the sum of
       the first n persons we are going to send to city A, that
       would be the first half after sorting.
    4. initializa a city_b_cost variable to store the the sum of
       the second n persons we are going to send to city B, that
       would starting from the half plus 1 after sorting.
    5. Run a loop and add the costs to each variable accordingly.
    6. Return the sum of both variables. That is the minimum cost
       to fly every person to each city.
