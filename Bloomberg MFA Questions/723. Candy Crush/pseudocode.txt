Crushing Steps:
    1. Initiate a "stable" flag to indicate the current status of our board.
    2. Use a sliding window technique to check when three or more cells are
       equal, vertically and horizontally.
    3. Add the equal cells to a set() variable that will contain the coordinates
       of all the crushable elements.
    4. Run a loop through the set() variable and update the coordinates on the
       current board to 0 (Crushing them).
    5. Whenever we encounter crushable elements using step 2, we set our flag
       variable to False.
    6. If there are no crushable elements, we return our current board.

Gravity Steps:
    1. Traverse the board starting for every column and as for the rows, we
       traverse them in reverse.
    2. Whenever we encounter a 0, we increase our offset by 1
    3. Then we'll update the current position that we're in with our offset
       coordinates.
