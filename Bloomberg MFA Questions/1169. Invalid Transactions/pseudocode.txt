Steps:
    0. Initialize an empty invalid_transaction list
    1. Traverse through the transactions
    2. For each transaction, we split the transaction by the comma
    3. Check if the current transaction exceeds $1000, if so, add the
       transaction to the invalid_transaction list and continue
    4. Otherwise, run a nested loop to check for every transaction in the list if
       if it meets the follwing conditions:
        1. Transaction occurs within 60 min
        2. Transaction has the same name
        3. Transaction occurs in a different city
       if every one of those conditions is met, we add the outside transaction
       to the invalid_transaction list
    5. Return the invalid_transaction list
