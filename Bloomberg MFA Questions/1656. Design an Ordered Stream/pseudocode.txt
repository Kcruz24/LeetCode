Steps:

* Constructor:
    1. initialize an empty stream array with the size of input “n” we are given.
    2. initialize a pointer with 0

* insert(id, value) method:
    1. put the given value to the (id - 1) position in our array.
    2. Initialize an empty ordered_stream array
    3. Run a loop that will run while our pointer is less than the length of
       the stream array and while there is a value in our stream[pointer] position
        a. append to the ordered_stream array our stream[pointer] value
        b. increase our pointer by 1
    4. return the ordered_stream array.
