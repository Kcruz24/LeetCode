* Constructor:
    1. Initialize two hashmaps, one to keep track of people when they check in,
        and one to keep track of the stations travel times and total trips.
        The hashmap that will keep track of the travel times and total trips
        will be initialized with a defaultdict() with a value of an empty list
        with a length of 2 (Like this â†’ [0, 0]). Ex:
            a. people_info = {}
            b. travel_times = defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0])

* checkIn(id, stationName, time) method:
    1. Just assign the current station and time to the corresponding
       person by their id.

* checkOut(id, stationName, time) method:
    1. Get the start station and start time from the current person who is
       checkin out, then we add at the first position of the travel_times
       hashmap the difference between the end time and start time (This would
       be the time it took for that person to travel from station_A to
       station_B), as for the second position, we just add one, indicating
       that a trip was made from those stations.

* getAverageTime(startStation, endStation) mehtod:
    1. We just need to get the total_time and total_trips from the corresponding
       start_station and end_station, after that, we just return total_time
       divided by the total_trips.
