Steps:
    1. Create the empty 's' string variable
    2. Initialize a counter variable to 1
    3. start a loop with the length of the input array
        1. if the prev char is equal to the current char:
            1. add one to the counter
        2. if the prev char is not equal to the current char
            1. append the prev char to the 's' variable
            2. append the current counter to the 's' variable
            3. reset counter to 1
    4. if counter is equal to 1:
        1. append only the char to the 's' variable
    5. else, append the last char with the current counter to the 's' variable.

    Modify input char array:
        1. start a loop with the length of the 's' variable
        2. at each iteration replace the corresponding idx position from the
        input variable with the a's' variable

    6. return the input chars variable sliced up until the length of the 's' variable
