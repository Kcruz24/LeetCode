nums1 = [4, 1, 2]
nums2 = [1, 3, 4, 2]

output = [-1, 3, -1]



Steps:
 1. set a pointer to the nums1 array
 2. Get the index of our pointer's values of the nums2 array
 3. Loop through the nums2 starting from the index of that value and check
    if there is a greater element, if that condition is true, append that
    to our output array, if not, append -1
