Steps:
    1. Intialize a stack as an empty list, the stack will store a list which
       consists of a list with a char and its count, ex:
           a. stack = [[char, counter]]
    2. Traverse through the string
    3. at each iteration check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the
       stack is equal to the current character, if it is, then add one to the counter
       on top of the stack, otherwise add the current character with a counter of
       1 to the stack
    4. then check again if the stack is not empty and if the counter on top of the
       stack is equal to k, if it is, then pop from the stack.
    5. Create a string from the stack by joining its values and return it
