Steps:
    1. check if the input head is null
    2. set a trav pointer to reference the head
    3. set a prev pointer equal to null
    4. Move trav along with prev to be at the starting point
       of the sub linked list to be reversed
    5. Leave a copy of both trav and prev pointers, these pointers
       will be fixing the final connections.
    6. Start a traditional reverse of the linked list
    7. At the end, if there's a copy of the prev pointer (tail_prev)
       assign tail_prev.next to be equal to prev (head after reversal),
       otherwise, set head to point to prev
    8. assign tail.next (the copy of trav) to point to trav
    9. return the head of the linked list.
