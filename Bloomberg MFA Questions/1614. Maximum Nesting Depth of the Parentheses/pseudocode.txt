Steps:
    1. Initialize an empty stack
    2. initialize a depth and maxDepth variables
    3. run a for loop for every character in the "s" string
    4. Whenever we find an open parenthesis, we add it to the
       stack and increase our depth by 1
    5. update the maxDepth with the max(maxDepth, depth)
    6. Whenever we find a closing parenthesis, we decrease our
       depth by 1
    7. Return the maxDepth variable
