Steps:

    1. Create hashmap of the frequencies in the “s” string
    2. Intialize a “steps” variable to keep track of the minimum number of steps
    3. for every character in the “t” string:
        a. Check if the current character count in the hashmap is greater than 0,
        if it is, we decrease the counter
        b. If the current character count is 0 meaning that is not in the “s”
        string anymore, we increase the “steps” variable by 1
    4. Return the “steps” variable
